# monolith
A data hoarder's dream come true: bundle any web page into a stand-alone HTML file.  
You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files  
stored somewhere on your precious little drive.

Unlike conventional "Save page as â€¦", `monolith` not only saves the target document,
but embeds JavaScript, CSS and image assets **all at once**, resulting  
in a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store and share.

Works both on remote and local targets.

If compared to saving websites with `wget -mpk`, `monolith` embeds all assets  
as data-URIs and therefore would display the page exactly the same at any given time,  
being completely independent from the Internet.

However, keep in mind that `monolith` is not aware of your browser's session.
